            		During the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic many companies have been forced to consider either alternative working arrangements for their employees or the option to furlough. Many of those affected are finding themselves at home, without routine, motivation or in some cases meaningful work to complete.
					<br/><br/>
					Stay At Home Because There’s A Pandemic Ltd (SAhBTAP) identified a new gap in the market that not only encourages employees to stick to their traditional working patterns as well as offering them something productive to do in their downtime.

                <p class="overview_header">Our Vision</p>
                <p class="overview_content">
					Our vision for this application is to fill the void of procrastination with entertaining daily challenges, as well as an alert setting feature to keep workers in line with their usual schedules. Challenges will range from brief puzzles (crosswords, sudoku, riddles) to longer activities (Bake-off style recipes, language learning tasks, at-home exercises) the variety aims to keep users returning to the application daily and introduces an element of excitement to the working day. Whilst working from home, employees can feel as though they lack basic daily structure as there is no pressure of a commute, lunch break or traditional end of the day and often end up working longer hours for little, to no, reward. The alert portion of the app is designed to allow the creation of alerts throughout the day that will remind users when to take a break, stop working or of easily forgotten deadlines. The alert system is not to be used as a replacement for those set-up elsewhere, for example wake-up alarms or meeting reminders, but more to bring structure back into the day as it’s easy to get carried away and suddenly realise it’s much later than intended.

					The Stay at Home Companion intends to be used by employees who have recently begun permanently working-from-home and are finding it difficult to adjust. There is no restriction on demographics including age/gender/religion as the challenge levels will be highly inclusive and set at a benchmarked standard, as well as dietary requirements highlighted where necessary.
