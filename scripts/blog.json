				"content": `This week has been going well from an all-round standpoint. We are collaborating more and more, making the most of the lockdown-ensured distancing by utilising WhatsApp and Microsoft Teams to
							pursue our work in a timely manner. As a team, we managed to produce our solution design
							document, outlining our requirements for the application at hand and setting in stone what we
							expect the application to look like at the end of development.
							<br/><br/>
							The development team have been working hard on the Hack and MVP, producing our first demo for
							the client which includes all the major functionality. We are pleased with the login functionality,
							alarms, and challenges within the app.
							<br/><br/>
							Of course, it's not been an easy ride, with issues around finding time along-side other pressing work
							and trying to keep a balance of work and play, but also, what really is easy given the current climate
							of social distancing with relation to the Coronavirus.
							<br/><br/>
							We are hoping more and more that the application can be delivered sooner rather than later due to
							all of us needing some sort of normality and routine. It's not just delivering it for the general public,
							we would also find it useful to have the application to keep us on track.
							<br/><br/>
							Our software quality document was also produced this week, which was another large undertaking.
							It seems as if we are already working towards quality software and teamwork which is the main goal
							of producing it, and probably why we found it so easy to produce. Olivia has a lovely design of spider
							diagrams which make the documents pop, along side Rob's detailed write ups that help to guide us
							on where to focus our efforts.
							<br/><br/>
							We're hoping to continue the way we have been working, keeping high spirits, and working towards
							our milestones quickly and efficiently. With bi (sometimes tri) weekly meetings, and maintaining our
							scrum methodology, we believe that our chances of success are heightened, and things should be
							relatively plain sailing from here until deadline.
							<br/><br/>
							That's all for this week, and regular updates should flow from here on out.
							<br/><br/>
							Thanks for reading!`
