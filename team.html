                	Alongside being a Degree Apprentice, I've been a Test Analyst with Capgemini for two and a half years. This involves verifying code for large public sector clients to ensure it is error free before public use.

                	My role on the Home Life Companion project is to manage the team ensuring they are organised and prepared for deadlines. This is a completely new experience for me, so I'm very grateful to have such understanding and patient colleagues! So far we've all been very co-collaborative and enthusiastic to make a difference within this crisis.

                	Hi, I‚Äôm Ben and I‚Äôm a degree apprentice software engineer. My day to day job outside of this project involves looking after a large software system coded in CA GEN integrated with UNIX shell script and SQL.
					<br/><br/>
					I am really excited to work on this project as it gives me a new flavour of software development using some more recent software languages. I am really enjoying working with the current team because no matter what is going on we‚Äôre always able to have a good laugh. 
					<br/><br/>
					My role in this project will be to undertaking the design and development of the software UI and working with Kelly to complete the coding for the rest of the application. Although this is far from my comfort zone I am really enjoying the process of learning the new technologies and can‚Äôt wait to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.
					<br/><br/>
					I‚Äôll be posting in the blog with what we‚Äôre doing so look out for updates üòä

                	Hi! I'm Kelly and I've been working in software development for four years now, starting out as an apprentice before moving into a degree apprenticeship. My current day-to-day job outside of this project is writing mobile applications using Xamarin Forms in C#, and there's nothing I love more than seeing a working a product at the end of all the hard work.
					<br/><br/>
					I'm really excited to work on this project, I can already tell we're going to be a great team and I'm looking forward to working with everyone throughout the duration of it! Our bi-weekly meetings don't feel like a chore at all as everyone is so encouraging and excited with the progress each of us are making and always offering to help where they can. It's so great to work with such motivated and committed people you can also have a good laugh with!
					<br/><br/>
					My core role as part of SAhBTAP will be undertaking development processes such as maintaining the server, website, databases, and of course helping bring the actual app to life by writing the code that makes it all work! There's a fair few new challenges for me here, particularly having never setup hosting for a server before! But I'm looking forward to all the new experiences and learning challenges this project has to offer. 
					<br/><br/>
					Look out for my updates in the blog! I'll be offering chirpy snippets of what's happening throughout the App development as well as any new changes to the website! üë©‚Äçüíª
